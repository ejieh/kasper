title: About me 
---

I have been writing code for over 10 years (mostly in Python) but now, I am currently building up and managing the Analytics team at [Gore Mutual](https://www.goremutual.ca/).

Before this, I was a Data Scientist at IBM Canada (Toronto). I joined IBM immediately after finishing my M.Sc in Computer Science at University of Windsor where I did some research in Natural Language Processing.

I live in the [KWC Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Municipality_of_Waterloo). Here is my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chux-ejieh-64b62970/) if you want to know more.

Everything in this blog is my personal opinion and should not be taken as the position of any employer, past or present.
