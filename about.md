title: About me 
---

I grew up in [Ile-Ife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E1%BA%B9), Nigeria. Now, I live in the [KWC Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Municipality_of_Waterloo), Canada. I am currently building up and managing the Analytics team at [Gore Mutual](https://www.goremutual.ca/) which I joined in Oct., 2018.

Before this, I was a Data Scientist in IBM Canada (Toronto) for over 2 years. I joined IBM immediately after finishing my M.Sc in Computer Science at University of Windsor where my research work was around an application of NLP.

I worked as a developer in Lagos, Nigeria for 2 years after completing my B.Sc in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics in 2012 at O.A.U, Ile-Ife Nigeria.
